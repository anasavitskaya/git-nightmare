This is a love song, real love
Dirty rip out the whole of your soul love
I'll hate myself for days love
Sitting all alone and listening to Nick Cave love
This is a dark song, real dark
Feral tear off your skin to the bone dark
I'll drink myself to death dark
Do anything to feel your breath on my neck dark
Can I sing this to you?
Got a thing about you
And it won't go away, no
It won't go away
It won't go away
This is a sad song, so sad
Aching like it's more that I can take sad
I cried so hard I died sad
Losing all that's making me human inside sad
